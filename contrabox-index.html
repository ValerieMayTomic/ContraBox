<h1> How to play </h1>
<p>
Players: 2 (blue and red)
<br><br>
Goal: Be the first to move your dark-colored player block to the purple exit.
<br><br>
Controls: On your turn, click a block (either your player block or one of your light-colored obstacle blocks) and use the arrow keys to move it. You can only move one block per turn - once you've started moving a block, you cannot select another block to move. When you are satisfied with the position of the block, hit space to finish your turn.
